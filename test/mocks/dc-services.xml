We are convinced that working smoke alarms are the single most important appliance in the home because they have been proven to save lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The requirements for receiving a free smoke alarm are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; You must live in the District of Columbia and show proof of residency.&lt;br&gt; You must be a homeowner and living in that home (not rental property).&lt;br&gt; The Department will install One Smoke Alarm Free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***** Please Note: The DC Fire &amp; EMS Department will make every effort to meet the requested date and time. The units assigned to install your smoke alarms will call 30 minutes to an hour prior to your requested time to insure that the resident is home. However, if the unit scheduled to install the alarm receives an emergency call, they must respond to the emergency first. This means that they may run late or not make the scheduled time. Once the emergency is over they will call to reschedule.****&lt;br&gt;</description>
